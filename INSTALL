Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `Install.sh' shell script.

The simplest way to Install this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./Install.sh' to configure and install the package for your system.
     If you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need
     to type `sh ./Install.sh' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to
     execute install itself.

     Running `Install.sh' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `PadPaper' to run PadPaper Editor 1.02.

  
Enjoy it!!
