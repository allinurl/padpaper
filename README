This is a basic a GUI text editor, it simply opens/saves and edits 
simple ascii text files. It possibly will be useful for making quick 
edits to files and things like that.
Right now its basic goal is to be a small text editor without many 
advanced features, however it may evolve into having specialized features.

It is released under the GNU general purpose license and this version 
has been slightly munged to work under MS Windows by Fuzzyman.
